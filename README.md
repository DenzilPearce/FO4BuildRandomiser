# FO4BuildRandomiser
### Fallout 4 Build Randomiser
Sick and tired of having a build that makes sense and actually works? If yes, this is the tool for you.

This tool generates random starting SPECIAL stats, and will generate a random perk for you every time you level up - it even takes SPECIAL bobbleheads you've collected and the choice you made with the "You're SPECIAL" book into account. You can save your build and load it up again next time you play, so you never need to lose track of the useless abomination you've created.

## How to use it
When you start the app, you can either click the "Load..." button to load a previously saved build, or generate a new one.
### Settings page
- **Include Far Harbor perks** Whether or not to use the additional perks provided by the Far Harbour DLC (disable if the DLC is not installed or active)
- **Include Nuka-World perks** Whether or not to use the additional perks provided by the Nuka-World DLC (disable if the DLC is not installed or active)
- **Minimum SPECIAL** The lowest possible value SPECIAL you wish to be generated
- **Maximum SPECIAL** The highest possible value SPECIAL you wish to be generated
- **Allow re-rolls** Whether or not you wish to allow re-rolling SPECIAL stats and new perks (disable to force yourself to commit to whatever nonsense the RNG throws at you)
- **Bias towards perks that have already been invested in** A value of 1 means the perk chosen when you level up will be chosen completely at random from the pool of perks that are available to be taken. A value of 2 slightly biases this choice in favour of perks that you have already taken one or more levels in. A value of 3 increases this bias even further.
- **Generate** Generate a new SPECIAL stats with the specified settings. Click "Accept" to accept the stats generated, or "Re-roll" to generate different stats (if you have allowed it)
- **Load...** Load a previously saved build

### Main page
- **You're SPECIAL** Use once you have read the "You're SPECIAL" book in Sanctuary to lock in your choice.
- **Bobblehead** Use once you have collected the bobblehead for that stat.
- **Level up** Use when you level up, and a random perk will be chosen for you to take, or re-roll if you have allowed it.
- **Save...** Save your current build.

## Notes
The tool will never increase a SPECIAL stat on level up - it will only ever roll perks that fit your existing SPECIAL. The idea is to create mostly awful builds that add an extra layer of challenge to a playthrough. With potentially unlimited SPECIAL stats, any character can eventually become good - I wanted to prevent that from happening.

If you're wondering why I didn't make this as a mod, the answer is simple: I have no idea how to make mods, and also I play on console so I don't have the tools to even attempt it. I put this together because it was something I wanted, and I took the quickest route available to me.
